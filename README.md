This is the script that you can deploy on the cloud or background to receive the email about whether there is an apartment available. So far, Amsterdam, Utrecht, and Rotterdam are included.
You have to enter your own password for your email in the file to execute the script. (Both Yahoo email and Gmail can set passwords for a third-party app. You just need a 2-step verification stuff before doing so.)
So far the price is filtered to that lower than 1000euro. Of course, you can adjust the threshold if you want.
This is just a test version.
